# go-web
###
A simple and opinionated web framework mostly based on the go standard library, scalable CSS approach (used in web.dev) and javascript import maps

## Usage
###
Make sure have `go` installed, preferabbly as recent as your platform of choice allows.

Install [air](https://github.com/cosmtrek/air) then run `air .air.toml`. This will build the executable into `tmp/` then run it. Details of what air runs are in the `build.sh` file.

## Developer tooling
###
- preconfigured `.air.toml` to be able to use it out of the box. Documentation on options available in the [air](https://github.com/cosmtrek/air) repository. Just run `air server.go .air.toml` to start the server app.
- automatic page reload with a simple socket signalling enabled by [gorilla/websocket](https://github.com/gorilla/websocket)

## Simple routing
###
Go STD provides this functionality out of the box. Examples for how to handle a few kinds of routes
- html output
- JSON API output using resource definitions instead of individual method-based routes
- pattern matching ability for various types of routes based on url pattern and method

## JWT middleware
###
- JWT examples, both issuing a new token at login, then validationg the JWT token and reading claims from the request

## Built-in go templates for rendering nested html templates
###
Go provides the `html/template` package to handle html templating. The `templates` folder contains all layouts and partials, where a layout defines a page layout while a partial is a reusable html snippet. Also, templates are embededd into the built binary with `embed.FS` to simplify delivery to production.

## Easily serve static files (css/js/images/etc)
###
App is easily serving static files from `public` folder like this: `/public/css/some.css` available on `/public/js/some.js` url. Also, static files are embedded into binary.

## Better CSS
###
Basic design system included based on [CubeCSS](https://cube.fyi/). Key principles:
- use progressive enhancement
- structure the CSS in these four groups: composition styles, utilities, blocks and exceptions
The most important part is that we should try to guide the browser to do what it does best (rendering) in a context that it finds itself in.

Design tokens are in a few files: defined colors, spacing values and text sizes, along with a global reset and global styling to bring all browsers on the same page. These are used to build the actual, fluid, styling of the pages.

## Nest, bundle and minify CSS
###
This done with `github.com/tdewolff/minify` and some custom nesting.

## Example configuration use 
###
Use c`config/config.go` to showcase some examples of how configuration will be done. Later environment variables will also be transitioned here.

## Use javascript import maps
###
JavaScript dependencies are installed with `npm` into the `assets/` folder, then minified/copied if needed into the `public` folder when the server starts. They are configured in the `config.toml` so that they become available as JavaScript import maps in the HTML head.
Where needed, [ES Module Shims](https://ga.jspm.io/npm:es-module-shims@1.5.1/dist/es-module-shims.js) is helping fill in the functional√∂ity in unsupportive browsers.

## Middleware
###
Example of middleware implementations, starting with a request logger, JWT verify middleware

## Upcoming features
###
- session handling, start with cookies
- database example, Posgres with [pgx](https://github.com/jackc/pgx)
- production build
