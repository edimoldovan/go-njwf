  <h1>I have decided to not blog</h1>
  <p class="summary-description">
    I have recently been reading a lot given that I had a lot of time on my hands. 
    Many of my readings have been about my work, what I'm passionate about in my work &mdash; how to build amazing experiences on the web and native platforms.
  </p>
  <p>
    So I have quickly put together this not blog to share not posts here. Read along if you&rsquo;re curious what this crazy idea is about.
  </p>
  <h2>What is a not blog?</h2>
  <p>
    I get an urge to try things out when I read about them. For example: I like a lot the <code>has()</code> CSS selector features. So I naturally want to try them out. But a traditional blog doesn&rsquo;t offer the opportunity to actually embed code easily into a post, like the features I&rsquo;m trying out.
  </p>
  <p>
    I could embed some tool into the post with code examples but I am not a big fan of such tools.
  </p>
  <p>
    Also, I would like to share the experience of building something from scratch, this not blog, so that whoever is curious, can follow how I build it.
  </p>
  <p>
    For instance, I would like to experiment and showcase how the <code>has()</code> selector works. For this I created the below <code>figure</code>:
  </p>
  <pre>
    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img src="/static/images/nothing_at_all_aiseo_art.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;
  </pre>
  <p>which renders like this:</p>
  <figure>
    <img src="/static/images/nothing_at_all_aiseo_art.jpg" />
  </figure>
  <p>
    the above <code>figure</code> with the colorful image and the one below look different only because the bottom one has a <code>figcaption</code>.
  </p>
  <pre>
    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img src="/static/images/nothing_at_all_aiseo_art.jpg" /&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;image generated with &lt;a href="https://art.aiseo.ai" target="_blank"&gt;https://art.aiseo.ai&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;
  </pre>
  <figure class="figure">
    <img src="/static/images/nothing_at_all_aiseo_art.jpg" />
    <figcaption>image generated with <a href="https://art.aiseo.ai" target="_blank">https://art.aiseo.ai</a></figcaption>
  </figure>
  <p>Here&rsquo;s the <span class="highlight">selector</span> that makes this possible (nb. stable Firefox seems to not support <code>has()</code> by default yet):</p>
  <pre>
    .prose <span class="highlight">figure:has(figcaption)</span> {
      background: var(--color8);
      padding: 2rem;
      max-width: 50ch;
      display: flex;
      flex-direction: column;
      align-items: center;
      gap: 1rem;
    }
  </pre>
  <p>The browser will add the additional styling only to the <code>figure</code>s that have a <code>figcaption</code> style.</p>
  
  <p>
    So if you are interested in <code>Go</code>, <code>SwiftUI</code>, good <code>CSS</code> practices and on top of everything a very <code>iterative</code>, <code>lean</code> delivey approach follow the story here.
